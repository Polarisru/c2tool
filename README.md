# c2tool

**c2tool** is a linux userspace application meant to enable in-system
programming on low pin-count Silicon Labs devices using the Silicon Labs
2-Wire Interface (C2).

## Existing kernel driver

There is a linux kernel driver (drivers/misc/c2port) for this, **but**

* hardware support is quite limited
* sysfs interface is not very intuitive
* `local_irq_disable()` affects real time performance
* GPIOs can be easily accessed from userspace

## Challenge

The C2 Clock signal is shared with an active-low reset signal on the
target device. Any clock pulse taking longer than 20us is interpreted as a reset
signal. The kernel driver is driving the clock line with `local_irq_disable()`
pulled to make sure the timing is valid. But this degrades system performance.

**c2tool** depends on hardware support for generating clock pulses that are in
the range from 20ns to 5000ns. In our reference application there is an FPGA but
a discrete monoflop should also do.

## Install

Dependencies:

* libpigpio

## Prerequisites

Two gpios have to be supplied to **c2tool**:

* c2d: Read/write access to the C2 Data pin
* c2ck: Write access to the  C2 Clock pin

## Usage

```
Usage:  c2tool <gpio c2d> <gpio c2ck>  command
Commands:
        version       
                Show SW version.

        info
                Show information about connected device.

        dump [offset] [len] <file>
                Dump flash memory of connected device to HEX file.

        flash <file>
                Write HEX file to flash memory of connected device.

        erase
                Erase flash memory of connected device.

        verify <file>
                Verify HEX file to flash memory of connected device.

        reset
                Reset connected device.
```
